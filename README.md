## Dependencies

## Basic configuration

### Add grouping options using drop down key or value

Sometimes if the options in your drop down are limited and you are well aware of the keys/values used in the dropdown you can configure the widget to use keys.

### Add grouping options using drop down text

On the other hand if you have somewhat large set of options and you feel comfortable with the texts instead of keys or values then you should prefer below configuration.

Provide the group names and the text it should contain. Also dont forget to select the radio option which makes this possible.
